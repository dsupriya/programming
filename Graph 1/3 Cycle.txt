3 Cycle

Given a graph with N vertices (numbered from 1 to N) and Two Lists (U,V) of size M where (U[i],V[i]) and (V[i],U[i]) are connected by an edge , then count the distinct 3-cycles in the graph. A 3-cycle PQR is a cycle in which (P,Q), (Q,R) and (R,P) are connected an edge.
Input Format :
Line 1 : Two integers N and M
Line 2 : List u of size of M
Line 3 : List v of size of M
Return Format :
The count the number of 3-cycles in the given Graph
Constraints :
1<=N<=100
1<=M<=(N*(N-1))/2
1<=u[i],v[i]<=N
Sample Input:
3 3
1 2 3
2 3 1
Sample Output:
1
